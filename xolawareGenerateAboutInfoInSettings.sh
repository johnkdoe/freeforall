# it differs from the stackoverflow answer in the following ways:
# - it assumes the -info.plist is per target
# - it assumes the usual Xcode default of creating a product directory containing the -info.plist
# - it assumes per-target naming of .plist files
# - it uses ${PRODUCT_NAME}/${TARGET_NAME} env-vars from Xcode to achieve this
# - it assumes there's a PSGroupSpecifier "About" containing the version as the first item
# - it assumes the version is already a PSTitleValueSpecifier, and is always first in Root.plist
# - it takes the "outputfile" as an argument, so that it can be invoked as shown in mrox's blog
#
# mrox's blog is helpful to show how to create the build phase that runs this script.
# the script invocation needs to be different in the following ways:
# - it is concerned with version information only, and thus not debug-only
# - it is invoked using Input File $(SRCROOT)/${PRODUCT_NAME}/Resources/Settings.bundle/Root.plist
# - it is invoked using File $(TARGET_BUILD_DIR)/$(FULL_PRODUCT_NAME)/Settings.bundle/Root.plist
