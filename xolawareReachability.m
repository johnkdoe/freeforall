 As per paragraph 1 of the forgoing license terms, xolawareReachability provides
 a modified version of Apple's original Reachability.m class header.  Being
 modified, retention of the forgoing is not strictly required, but provided to
 establish the chain of copyright from which this source was derived.

 xolaware LLC makes no claim as to any endorsement by Apple, and refers to Apple
 in this copyright notice only to establish chain of copyright from which this
 source was derived.
 
 xolaware source code makes use of xolawareReachability.m solely to satisfy
 guidelines set forth by Apple in their "App Store Submission Typs" under the
 sub-heading "Don't Forget to Include Network Error Alerts in Your Code" at URL
 http://developer.apple.com/appstore/resources/submission/tips.html , and which
 refers explicitly to the "Reachability sample application" available at URL
 https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/samplecode/Reachability/index.html to
 members of the iOS Developer Program.

 xolaware makes no claims or reservations on this software, expect to require that any direct
 use or derivation of this file should retain this chain of copyright and the chain of
 modifications below:
 - renamed xolawareReachability to differentiate from the Apple file
 - #import <netinet/in.h> moved to .h to silence warning regarding struct sockaddr_in
 - don't #import <netinet/in6.h> to suppress preprocessor issue in that file: see RFC2553
 - #define kShouldPrintReachabilityFlags set to 0
 - #if kShouldPrintReachabilityFlags moved to streamline code
 - added simple + (BOOL)connectedToNetwork when not waiting for notification for reachability
 - refactored code in several members functions to new member - (struct sockaddr_in)zeroAddress
 - added simple + (void)alertNetworkUnavailable when simplest message to user required
